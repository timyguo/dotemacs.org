This is my personal info/dir, which contains the
topmost node of the Info hierarchy, called (dir)Top.

There are two dir files in my config, which get squished together by emacs.

The first time you invoke Info you start off looking at this node.

File: dir,	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree

  "q" exits, "?" lists all Info commands, "d" returns here,
  "h" gives a primer, "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs manual, etc.
