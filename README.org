Playing around with your emacs config is all about trying out new
stuff, adding new packages, tweaking bindings and deleting old stuff
you no longer need.  

This repo aims to be all about that and is used as a bit of an
emacs laboratory.

The use of org-mode as the lab is what separates this
dotemacs from other (perhaps more rigorous) patterns.  Org-mode is used:
+ as a literate programming environment
+ for its ease of header manipulation, its column view and tangling ability. If you haven'n tried it
  yet, go to the top of the file and hit C-c C-x C-c. Turning on and
  off, adding and subtracting code requires a simple edit of the
  tangle property.
+ for org-tables. The init.el file is data and much of this data
  belongs in a table. Where it makes sense, we place data in a table,
  often with a toggle to again turn things on and off. Babel then
  takes care of turning the table into code.  Simple as C-c C-v t.  

Right at this commit, dotemacs.org is a collision of three very
different influences:
  - the inspirational Eric Schulte org'ified starter-kit
  - the awesome personal dots of John Wiegley
  - the haphazard and largely newbish way I have gathered together my
    personal dots (but no more!)

If you make it as far as looking through the repo, can I suggest you
start with dotemacs.org, which contains everything. Run it in column
mode (C-c C-x C-c) and you'll see how I'm using the file.

It might just work out of the box if elpa is turned on.
